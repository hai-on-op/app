                    We use cookies on the website. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and
                    displays on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you access the Services. Cookies do
                    not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans, or other malicious software. Cookie
                    information is stored, and may result in a connection with a specific terminal or browser being
                    used. This does not, however, mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. The use of
                    cookies serves to increase the usability of the Services. For example, we use session cookies to
                    recognize that you have already visited individual pages, or that you have completed certain tasks
                    or reached certain goals. These are automatically deleted after leaving the Services. In addition,
                    to improve usability, we also use temporary cookies that are stored on your device for a specified
                    period of time, typically 30 days. If you access the Services again, it will automatically recognize
                    that you have already been with us and what inputs and settings you have made, so you do not have to
                    re-enter them. We also use cookies to statistically record the use of the Services, and to evaluate
                    that use for the purpose of optimizing the Services. These cookies allow us to automatically
                    recognize that you have already been with us when you once again access the Services. These cookies
                    are automatically deleted after a defined time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However,
                    you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or always provide a
                    hint appearing before a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that
                    you cannot use all features of the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. You also can opt-out of
                    certain cookies using the following link: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. You can reset
                    your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features of the
                    Services may not work properly without cookies. To learn more about cookies generally, visit

                <p>
                    Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a &ldquo;Do
                    Not Track&rdquo; (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) or similar feature that signals to websites that a User does
                    not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a
                    particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting
                    certain information about the browser&rsquo;s User. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT
                    signals are not yet uniform. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to
                    browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. You also can typically remove and reject
                    Cookies or Local Storage from the Services with your browser settings. Many browsers are set to
                    accept Cookies and Local Storage until you change your settings. If you remove or reject Cookies or
                    Local Storage, it could affect how the Services work for you. In all circumstances, we may perform
                    the foregoing information collection practices directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these
                    functions on our behalf. Also, if you access the Website or the Services from a social networking
                    service, we may share information with such social networking service in accordance with this
                    Privacy Policy and to the extent permitted by your agreement with such social networking service and
                    its privacy settings.

                <p>
                    We may also use other technologies such as Local Storage and Pixel Tags. &ldquo;Local Storage&rdquo;
                    is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store and retrieve data
                    on a person&rsquo;s computer, mobile phone or other device. We may use device or HTML5 Local
                    Storage, caching or other forms of Local Storage to store your preferences, help us remember certain
                    information about how you interact with the Services or display content on the through the Services
                    based upon what you have viewed on various other websites. We may also use &ldquo;pixel tags,&rdquo;
                    &ldquo;web beacons,&rdquo; &ldquo;clear GIFs&rdquo; or similar means (individually or collectively,
                    &ldquo;Pixel Tags&rdquo;) in connection with the Services to collect usage, demographic and
                    geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is
                    ordinarily not visible to you and may be associated with Cookies on your hard drive or Local
                    Storage. Pixel Tags allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages or parts of
                    the Services, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or
                    advertising campaigns. In addition, we may from time to time work with third-party companies,
                    including advertisers, that use Cookies, Local Storage and other tracking technologies to collect
                    non-identifying information about your activities on the Website or the Services in order to help us
                    better understand the use and operation of the Website and the Services. These third parties may
                    collect and analyze information about your online activities over time and across different websites
                    when you access or use the Services. We do not exercise control over these third party websites or

                    services you use. By accepting this Privacy Policy, and by accessing or using the Website or the

                    registration until you unsubscribe. You can unsubscribe from e-mail at any time, except that we may
                    still send you an email if you request a password reset. A corresponding unsubscribe link can be
                    found in every e-mail. A message to the above or in the specified contact information (e.g. by
                    e-mail or letter) is also sufficient. The legal basis of this processing is your consent in

                    statistical evaluations as well as for the optimization and further development of our content and
                    customer communication. This is done with the help of small graphics that are embedded in the e-mail
                    (so-called pixels). The data is collected exclusively pseudonymized and also not linked with your
                    other personal information. Legal basis for this is our aforementioned legitimate interest. Through
                    our e-mail, we want to share content relevant to our customers and better understand what readers
                    are actually interested in. If you do not want us to include your information in our analysis of
                    usage behavior, you can unsubscribe from e-mails or deactivate graphics in your e-mail program by
                    default. The data for the interaction with our e-mails may be stored pseudonymously for 30 days and
                    then completely anonymized.

                    As a matter of principle, we store personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the
                    contractual or legal obligations to which we have collected the data. Thereafter, we delete the data
                    immediately, unless we need the data until the expiration of the statutory limitation period for
                    evidence for civil claims or for statutory storage requirements.

                    Even after that, we sometimes have to save your data for accounting reasons. We are obliged to do so

                    we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology in connection with the highest encryption level

                    your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or
